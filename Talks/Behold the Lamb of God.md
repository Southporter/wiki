## Behold the Lamb of God [^1]



There are some of you here that may remember the old days, back when we had 3 hour church. Perhaps there are even some of you that remember the days even before that. There have been a lot of changes to our church worship services: the Come Follow Me curriculum, crazy schedules, block and home teaching, etc. And in the future, there will probably be even further changes. Throughout these changes there has been one thing that has remained the same: Sacrament meeting. In fact, the shortening of the church block is to focus more on this sacred meeting.



When we come to Sacrament Meeting on a Sabbath morning, we are coming to kneel before the sacrament table, quite literally "com[ing] unto Christ". We are coming into the presence of our Lord. 



His invitation is to come and partake of His sacrament and His Atonement. We are invited to come and partake, in a physical sense, of His suffering and His great work. We can also partake spiritually, emotionally, mentally, but this requires much of us individually. It requires us to come with a "broken heart and contrite spirit". It requires us to listen and ponder on the sacrament hymn and the sacrament prayers. It requires mental effort.



There are 2 parts to the sacrament. As spoken of in the New Testament and Book of Mormon, there is the physical emblems, which are the Lord's side of the Covenant. The bread signifies Christ's body, pierced and torn for us. The water signifies Christ's blood which He spilled freely and willingly. These emblems symbolize Christ's Atonement or ransom of us, each individually saved from the grasp of sin.

The bread and water in and of themselves are plain and ordinary. To eat bread and drink water is an everyday experience of no consequence. 

It is because the action of eating bread and drinking water is so common place that the Lord chose these symbols. "I am the bread of life" [^2], and "partake of the waters of life"[^3] are an invitation to "always have His Spirit to be with them". It is a reminder that we are to make Him a constant part of our lives, to rely on him as much or more than we rely on food and water daily.

The power of the Lord's Sacrament lies in the symbolism of and our personal approach to this sacred ordinance. It is our own personal little sacrifice, not unlike the sacrifice of them of old of a unblemished, male lamb.

As with any Covenant or Ordinance, we have a part in this too. Throughout the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord commands us to "go to the house of prayer and offer up *thy* sacraments"[^4], "assembl[e] yourselves together to offer up *your* sacraments"[^5], and "rejoice together, and offer a sacrament unto the Most High"[^6]. We are to bring our sacrament, namely a "broken heart and contrite spirit"[^?] to the altar. We are to bring a dependence on "Him who is mighty to save"[^?]. We are to come willing to repent and "be perfected in Him"[^?]



So much of the world is centered on the "I". Am I good enough at my job? Am I liked enough on social media? Am I getting my fair share?

As we approach the sacrament, we are asked to center on the "I", but in a different way. Am I loving my family and my neighbors sufficiently? Am I serving as much as I can? Am I truly penitent of my sins?

... We have someone to rely on as we work towards perfection. Perhaps this is also part of the symbolism of the sacrament, that as we ingest the bread and water we are saying that we are taking a part of Him into us. A part of His charity, His patience, His virtue, His humility, or His diligence and obedience become part of us as we strive to "be perfected in Him". 

The Messiah's command to "be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father ... is perfect" is a steep and demanding injunction. But we do not, and cannot do that alone. It is only in and through our Savior that we can become perfected. He is right there for, just as He was for a sinking, distraught Peter in a boisterous sea, or for the woman with an issue of blood 12 years, or for a sincere, confused Joseph Smith in the Sacred grove. He is right there to strengthen you.

That doesn't meant there won't be hardships and trials. That doesn't mean you won't feel overwhelmed and confused. It does mean that you always have someone at your back, always have someone to cheer you on, always have someone with whom you can share your burdens. I promise you, He will make your burdens light and dry your tears.
