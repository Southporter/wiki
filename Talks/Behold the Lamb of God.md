## Behold the Lamb of God [^1]





When we come to Sacrament Meeting on a Sabbath morning, we are coming to kneel before the sacrament table, quite literally "com[ing] unto Christ". We are coming into the presence of our Lord. Should we not be at least a little more careful and meticulous in our dress?



To converse, to connect, to enjoy community, these are indeed good reasons to attend church. But let us not forget the primary and principle reason for attending this and every Sacrament meeting: to remember Christ and partake of His sacrament.

His invitation is to come and partake of His sacrament, even His Atonement. We are invited to come and partake, in a physical sense, of His suffering and His great work. We can also partake spiritually, emotionally, mentally, but this requires much of us individually. It requires us to come with a "broken heart and contrite spirit". It requires us to listen and ponder on the sacrament hymn and the sacrament prayers. It requires mental effort.

Having a little one, I understand how difficult it can be to focus on the sacrament and the meaning behind the ordinance. My son likes to wiggle and squirm as much as any kid, and it can be distracting. And I am sure the Savior sees this effort and accepts it as much as any other offering at the sacrament table.





So much of the world is centered on the "I". Am I good enough at my job? Am I liked enough on social media? Am I getting my fair share?

As we approach the sacrament, we are asked to center on the "I", but in a different way. Am I loving my family and my neighbors sufficiently? Am I serving as much as I can? Am I truly penitent of my sins?





The bread and water in and of themselves are plain and ordinary. To eat bread and drink water is an everyday experience of no consequence. 

It is because the action of eating bread and drinking water is so common place that the Lord chose these symbols. "I am the bread of life" [^2], "partake of the waters of life"[^3] 

The power of the Lord's Sacrament lies in the symbolism of and our personal approach to this sacred ordinance. It is our own personal little sacrifice, not unlike the sacrifice of them of old of a unblemished, male lamb.
