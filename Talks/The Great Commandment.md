# The Great Commandment

#### Learning From Ancient Israel

##### Set up mindset

Almost 3 $\frac{1}{2}$ millenia ago, Moses led a beleagured group of roughly 1 million people out of a shattered and broken Egypt. These people had spent the last few weeks witnessing miracle after miracle as their God worked to free them from the tyrannical grasp of a delusional monarch. As they were led off into the wilderness, perhaps they were not fully aware of the trials they would face, and the changes they would have to make. My guess is that when they had prayed for deliverance, they hoped for a quick change from the drudgery of slavery to a luxurious life in a land of milk and honey. I am sure that they did not expect 40 years of wandering in the wilderness.

As the Israelites began to troop through the wilderness, God sought to teach them more about who He is. He wanted them to understand Him, to know Him, to love Him. In Exodus 19 God tells Moses: "Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with the and believe thee for ever." He wanted the people to know that He was the true and living God. That He was there, protecting and watching over them.

Perhaps this is why He had such a strong reaction to their creation of the golden calf.  The Israelites had been surrounded by pagan traditions for several hundred years. They were used to viewing gods by their idols and sacred animals. It was a common practice at the time to create some representation of a god and begin to worship that representation. While Moses tarried on the mountain, the Israelites resorted back to what they were familiar with. They told Aaron "Up, make us gods, which shall go before us".



##### Where they went wrong

One might wonder: why was the golden calf such an issue? The issue with the idol is twofold.

One, they confused God with riches. The gold for the calf came from their earrings and other embellishments. It symbolized wealth and excess.

Two, they did it their own way. They had Aaron, a man, create the calf with his own hands.

What they did not realize was they had rejected God. They had replaced him with their own ideas, their own methods. They had "turned aside quickly out of the way which [God] commanded them".

God's way was to have a tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant, and to go before them as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. He would be with them and He would lead them. They would know He was there.



#### Jesus Answers the Question

Over a thousand years later, the Israelites were still struggling to understand who God was and what He required of them. When He came among them in a tabernacle of flesh and blood, they were still worshiping idols, but of a different sort.

###### Explain Pharises

One of the well known sects of Judaism at the time of Jesus Christ were the Pharisees. The Bible Dictionary tells us that this 

> religions party... prided themselves on their strict observance of the law and on the care with which they avoided [unclean things]
>
> The tendency of their teaching was to reduce religion to the observance of a multiplicity of ceremonial rules and to encourage self-sufficiency and spiritual pride.

Read Mark 7:7-9

* The Law became their God

* Worshiped the Law, and the living of the Law, not the God it pointed to

* 613 Commandments. Made them more tedious.

  * > For they bind heavy burdens and grevous to be borne, and ley them on men's shoulders; bu they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
    > But all their works they do for to be seen of men   -- Matthew 23:4-5

Matthew 5:5-6

Read the question and Christ's Response: Matt 22:35-37



#### Why

* Upon these two commandments hang all the laws and the prophets
  * All other commandments are just another way of saying one of these 2 commandments
    * Don't steal
      * In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these; Matt 25:40
    * Law of Chastity
      * respect for our bodies which are in the image of God
    * Keep the Sabbath day holy
      * God rested. How much more do we need to rest
  * If ye love me, keep my commandments

* Loving God leads us to loving others

  * > Believing God leads to faith in Him and developing trust in His word.  Faith causes our hearts to grow in our love for God and others. As that  love grows, we are inspired to emulate the Savior as we continue our own great journey on the path of discipleship.  -- Deiter Uctdorf Oct 2018

> God requires us to obey His commandments because only through that obedience... can we return to live in His presence and become perfect as He is.

>This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. 



##### Loving God with All Your Whole Self

###### Heart 

* Feelings

  * We must love God above all other earthly feelings:

    > Because of that love, we cannot let our love supersede the commandments and the plan and work of God, which we know will bring those we love their greatest happiness. -- Dallin Oaks Oct 2019

* Motivation

  * > All that we do should be motivated by our love for Him and for His Son.  As we develop our love for Them by keeping Their commandments, our capacity to love ourselves and to love others will increase. We will begin to serve family, firends, and neighbors because we will see them as the Savior sees them -- as sons and daughters of God.   -- Peter M Johnson Oct 2019

###### Soul

* Actions
* Listen: We listen through spiritual ears.
  * "He that hath ears, let him hear."
* Soul is the whole that is our body and spirit

###### Mind

* Thoughts
* We must decide what we put first:
* Story from mission:
  * Out for a year
  * Left for the right reasons
  * Struggled with street contacting: Felt like I was intruding
  * Let my fear get the better of me
  * Christmas/home sick/discouraged
  * Had to make choice:
    * Go home, give up, and leave what I knew God wanted me to do?
    * Stay, struggle, grow, serve
  * I chose stay, still struggled.



#### How

Not enough to just Believe: James 2: 19-23

"First or highest in rank or importance, principle"

Primary means by which we come closer to God.

* Scripture Study, including General Conference talks
* Daily Meaningful Prayer
* Weekly Sacrament Meeting attendance



#### Ending

> My beloved brothers and sisters, I am not certain just what our  experience will be on Judgment Day, but I will be very surprised if, at  some point in that conversation, God does not ask us exactly what Christ asked Peter: “Did you love me?” I think He will want to know if in our  very mortal, very inadequate, and sometimes childish grasp of things,  did we at least understand one commandment, the first and greatest  commandment of them all—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy  heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all  thy mind” ([Luke 10:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.27?lang=eng#26); see also [Matthew 22:37–38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37-38?lang=eng#36)). And if at such a moment we can stammer out, “Yea, Lord, thou knowest  that I love thee,” then He may remind us that the crowning  characteristic of love is always loyalty.
>
> “If ye love me, keep my commandments” ([John 14:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.15?lang=eng#14)), Jesus said. So we have neighbors to bless, children to protect, the  poor to lift up, and the truth to defend. We have wrongs to make right,  truths to share, and good to do. In short, we have a life of devoted  discipleship to give in demonstrating our love of the Lord. We can't  quit and we can't go back. After an encounter with the living Son of the living God, nothing is ever again to be as it was before.
